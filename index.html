    <!-- LETTER -->
    <section id="letter" class="card locked">
      <h2>A Letter 💌</h2>

      <div class="paper" id="letterPaper">
        <p><strong>My Sudu,</strong></p>

        <p>
          If I could, I would turn every memory into a place we can visit whenever we miss each other.
          So I made this — a small world where you can feel me close, even when distance tries to be loud.
        </p>

        <p>
          We didn’t start like a perfect love story. We started in a foundation program… with normal days,
          small moments… and one very serious crime: you refusing to buy me coffee at FAB 😤☕
        </p>

        <p>
          Then slowly, without warning, you became the person I wanted to talk to at night.
          Calls that went too long. Texts that felt like home.
          Even after the scolding… even after the rejection… my feelings didn’t disappear.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I stopped giving you attention, you finally felt what I felt — that something was missing.
          And when you asked me out, I said yes… and life became lighter.
          We went everywhere. We laughed. We annoyed each other.
          We proved that love is not only in big moments, but in small everyday effort.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then the UK happened. The rain, that cafe near my house, and that “let’s stop this” moment…
          It hurt, but it also showed the truth: we can’t replace each other.
          From far away, we learned how much we really need each other.
          And our bond didn’t weaken — it grew stronger.
        </p>

        <p>
          Two years later, when you came back for those three weeks…
          I felt it again — the same safety, the same excitement, the same “this is my person” feeling.
          And even now, when we fight, we still can’t keep anger for long…
          because love is bigger than ego for us.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sudu, I am proud of you. I believe in you.
          And I love you in a way that stays — through distance, time zones, exams, stress, and everything.
          I don’t need a special day to love you… but I’ll still choose you on every special day anyway.
        </p>

        <p>
          Happy Valentine’s, my love.
          Keep this website like a little reminder that you are loved deeply — by me.
